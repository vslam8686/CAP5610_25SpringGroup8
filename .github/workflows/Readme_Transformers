##The code is pretty straightforward. You only need to install the following libraries and you should be ready to go in 1 click:
##pip install pandas
##pip install numpy
##pip install matplotlib
##pip install scikit-learn
##pip install pytorch-lightning
##pip install pytorch-tabular
##I also used CUDA 11.8, since it was compatible with my GPU but you can either run it normally or Upgrade to a newer version if your GPU is more modern.
##pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
